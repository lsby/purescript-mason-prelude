Available as `ursi.prelude` in [purs-nix](https://github.com/ursi/purs-nix).

This prelude has two objectives

- Export things that are commonly used/recognizable that are also not likely to be the name of anything else.

- Add small QoL improvements that don't really deserve their own library (e.g. the `%` and `^` operators).

I update this as I naturally come across things I think should be included. This is my personal prelude but if you find yourself using it, feel free to submit a PR.

Regarding documentation, I don't think I can really do much better than `MasonPrelude.purs`, as it explicitly shows what's exported.
